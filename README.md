```sql
-- Total income and expenses by month
SELECT 
  Month,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `Income/Expense` = 'Income' THEN `Debit/Credit` ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Income,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `Income/Expense` = 'Expense' THEN `Debit/Credit` ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Expense,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `Income/Expense` = 'Income' THEN `Debit/Credit` ELSE -`Debit/Credit` END) AS Net_Savings
FROM finance_data
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
